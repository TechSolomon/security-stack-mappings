            <h1>Amazon Web Services Security Control Mappings to MITRE ATT&amp;CK®</h1>
<p>These mappings of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) security controls to MITRE ATT&amp;CK® are designed to empower organizations with independent data on which native AWS security controls are most useful in defending against the adversary TTPs that they care about. These mappings are part of a collection of mappings of native product security controls to ATT&amp;CK based on a common methodology, scoring rubric, data model, and tool set. This full set of resources is available on the Center’s project <a href="https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/our-work/security-stack-mappings-aws/">page</a>.</p>

<h2><img alt="GCP icon" src="/security-stack-mappings/icons/aws_icon.png" /> 1. AWS Artifact</h2>
<p>AWS Artifact is a central resource that provides on-demand access to AWS's security and compliance reports and online agreements. Available reports include Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, Payment Card Industry (PCI) reports, and certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and compliance verticals that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of AWS security controls. Agreements available include the Business Associate Addendum (BAA) and the Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA).</p>

</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>This control was not mapped because AWS Artifact provides access to reports and information but does not protect against any ATT&amp;CK techniques. All protections against ATT&amp;CK techniques are provided by the lower-level services evaluated by and referenced in those reports.  </p>

<h2><img alt="GCP icon" src="/security-stack-mappings/icons/aws_icon.png" /> 2. AWS Audit Manager</h2>
<p>AWS Audit Manager automates evidence collection from other services (notably AWS Config, AWS Security Hub, AWS API calls, and AWS CloudTrail) for evaluation against compliance frameworks/regulations and transformation into audit-friendly reports.</p>

<li><a href="layers/AWSAuditManager.json">Navigator Layer</a> (<a href="layers/AWSAuditManager.json">JSON</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>This control was not mapped because AWS Audit Manager is used to aggregate evidence from other services in order to produce audit-ready reports, not provide protection against any ATT&amp;CK techniques or adversary behaviors. All protections against ATT&amp;CK techniques are provided by the lower-level services used for the evidence collection, which are assessed in different mappings.  </p>

<p>AWS Certificate Manager is an Amazon service that supports the creation, storage, and renewal of public and private SSL/TLS X.509 certificates and keys that protect AWS websites and applications.</p>

<li><a href="layers/AWSCertificateManager.json">Navigator Layer</a> (<a href="layers/AWSCertificateManager.json">JSON</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>This control was not mapped because AWS Certificate Manager simply issues certificates for use in other AWS services such as Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Nitro Enclaves, and AWS CloudFormation. It does not inherently protect against any ATT&amp;CK techniques as it cannot be used to deploy certificates to other AWS services. That must be done either manually or with services integrated into AWS Certificate Manager.  </p>

<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>This control was not mapped because AWS Firewall Manager is simply a management service for other AWS security services. It does not inherently protect against any ATT&amp;CK (sub-)techniques. All protections against ATT&amp;CK (sub-)techniques are provided by the lower-level services that it manages (e.g., AWS WAF, AWS Network Firewall, etc.).  This is evident by the fact that to use firewall rules or security groups, they must first be configured in the respective lower-level services.   </p>

<h2><img alt="GCP icon" src="/security-stack-mappings/icons/aws_icon.png" /> 12. AWS IoT Device Defender</h2>
<p>AWS IoT Device Defender is a security service that allows users to audit the configuration of their Internet of Things (IoT) devices, monitor connected devices to detect abnormal behavior, and mitigate security risks. It provides the ability to enforce consistent security policies across AWS IoT device fleets and respond when devices are compromised.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>Mappings for AWS IoT Device Defender audit are based on the current set of AWS IoT Device Defender audit checks that can be enabled. AWS IoT Device Defender's predefined mitigation actions are also included for those audit checks that support them. Audit checks can be run as needed (on-demand audits) or scheduled to be run periodically (scheduled audits), so temporal scoring factors are uniformly high for this control, based on the assumption that checks are run (at minimum) on a frequent basis. Audit check and mitigation names are identified in quotes throughout this mapping.<br />
Mappings for AWS IoT Device Defender detect are based on the current set of AWS IoT Device Defender device-side and cloud-side detection metrics. Cloud-side detection alarms are triggered when set thresholds are exceeded, and device-side detection metrics are published on a chosen interval with a minimum value of 5 minutes, so temporal scoring factors are uniformly high for this control, based on the assumption that thresholds are set to sensible values that detect suspicious values quickly and device-side metric publishing is not set to an unreasonably large interval. Detect metric names are identified in quotes throughout this mapping.  </p>

S3 Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.  In addition, S3 Cross Region Replication can be used to replicate S3 buckets to another AWS region for add protection.</td>

<h2><img alt="GCP icon" src="/security-stack-mappings/icons/aws_icon.png" /> 20. AWS Security Hub</h2>
<p>AWS Security Hub is a tool that supports the aggregation, organization, and prioritization of security alerts and findings from multiple services including Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer, AWS Systems Manager, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions. To do this, AWS Security Hub relies on managed insights which are collections of findings that identify security areas that need to be addressed as well as custom checks for different detections. While AWS Security Hub supports  custom insights and numerous AWS Config checks, this mapping focuses only on the managed insights  and the custom Security Hub checks provided by Amazon. Custom managed insights and AWS Config checks are considered out of scope for this mapping as the custom managed insights will vary from organization  to organization and AWS Config has its own mapping. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="AWSSecurityHub.yaml">Mapping File</a> (<a href="AWSSecurityHub.yaml">YAML</a>)</li>
<li><a href="layers/AWSSecurityHub.json">Navigator Layer</a> (<a href="layers/AWSSecurityHub.json">JSON</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>Managed Insights: AWS Security Hub reports on collections of related findings which are known as managed insights. When possible, these managed insights are mapped to ATT&amp;CK techniques (e.g., "S3 buckets with public write or read permissions"). It should be noted that not all managed insights have the level of detail to be able to map them to ATT&amp;CK techniques and are not included in the mapping (e.g., "EC2 instances involved in known Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)"). <br />
AWS Config: AWS Security Hub supports reporting on findings from AWS Config (e.g., for CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark controls among others). Given that AWS Config is its own service, these findings will not be mapped to ATT&amp;CK. The only controls that will be included in this mapping  are those for which Security Hub implements custom logic. It should also be noted that there will  be a future CTID project that maps specific CIS Benchmarks to ATT&amp;CK techniques. </p>

<h2><img alt="GCP icon" src="/security-stack-mappings/icons/aws_icon.png" /> 21. AWS Shield</h2>
<p>AWS Shield is a service that protects against Distributed Denial of Service attacks. There are two tiers for this service Standard and Advanced.<br />
AWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport (Layer 3 and 4 attacks) layer DDoS attacks that target your web site or applications.<br />
AWS Shield Advanced adds on to standard by providing additional detection and mitigation against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks. There is near real-time visibility into attacks. AWS Shield Advanced also comes with 24x7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT).</p>

</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>There is not much documentation that lends itself useful to scoring the accuracy of this control although offerings such as Shield Advanced protection groups and the AWS Shield Response Team (SRT) can be leveraged to improve the accuracy of this control. The control states that DDOS attacks can be mitigated in real time (temporal factor) and not increase cause latency for impacted services.  </p>

<h2><img alt="GCP icon" src="/security-stack-mappings/icons/aws_icon.png" /> 25. Amazon Detective</h2>
<p>Amazon Detective is an automated data enrichment tool that extracts time-based events from other services such as AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC flow logs, and GuardDuty.<br />
These events include: login attempts,  API calls,  and network traffic and can be very useful in understanding security issues or operational account activity. Amazon Detective uses machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to help you visualize and conduct faster and more efficient security investigations.</p>

<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>Scores for this service are capped at Partial due to limited coverage and accuracy information.<br />
The temporal factor for this control is consistent: the first instance of a finding taking place is alerted within 5 minutes of the event occurring. After that any subsequent events can be customized to be reported at 15 minutes, 1 hour, or the default of 6 hours.<br />
The following findings were not mappable:<br />

<h2><img alt="GCP icon" src="/security-stack-mappings/icons/aws_icon.png" /> 28. Amazon Macie</h2>
<p>Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to help you discover, monitor, and protect sensitive data in your AWS environment.  Macie automates the discovery of sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, to provide you with a better understanding of the data that your organization stores in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).<br />
Macie also provides you with an inventory of your S3 buckets, and it automatically evaluates and monitors those buckets for security and access control. Within minutes, Macie can identify and report overly permissive or unencrypted buckets for your organization.<br />
If Macie detects sensitive data or potential issues with the security or privacy of your data, it creates detailed findings for you to review and remediate as necessary.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>Although the service detects the instance of sensitive data, it does not create an alert for the user to take immediate action. It does create a log report which the user can then view to see the results of the scan jobs.    </p>

<h2><img alt="GCP icon" src="/security-stack-mappings/icons/aws_icon.png" /> 29. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</h2>
<p>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a service that lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define.  Amazon VPC provides advanced security features that allow you to perform inbound and outbound filtering at the instance and subnet level.  Amazon VPC also has monitoring features that let you perform functions like out-of-band monitoring and inline traffic inspection, which help you screen and secure traffic.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>The mappings contained in this file were based on Amazon's "Security in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud" documentation listed in the references section. The following VPC components were assessed to produce this mapping: Security Groups, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs), VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints, and Virtual Private Network (VPN).  </p>

<td align="left">The VPC service's support for the AWS Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be used to encrypt traffic traversing over untrusted networks which can mitigate Man-in-the-Middle attacks that manipulate network protocol data in transit. VPC Peering can also be utilized to route traffic privately between two VPCs which can reduce the Man-in-the-Middle attack surface.  VPC Endpoints can also similarly reduce the attack surface of Man-in-the-Middle attacks by ensuring network traffic between a VPC and supported AWS services are not exposed to the Internet.</td>
